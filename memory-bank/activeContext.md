## Current Focus

âœ… **COMPLETED**: Landing page with authentication forms has been successfully implemented and deployed.

## Recent Changes

### Landing Page Implementation (Issue #3)
- **Fixed**: Google Fonts connectivity issue by switching to system fonts
- **Created**: Responsive landing page with hero section and authentication card
- **Implemented**: Login form with email/password validation
- **Implemented**: Registration form with name/email/password/confirm password validation
- **Added**: Comprehensive client-side form validation with error messages
- **Styled**: Mobile-first responsive design using Tailwind CSS v4
- **Ensured**: Accessibility with semantic HTML and ARIA attributes
- **Tested**: All acceptance criteria scenarios successfully verified

### Component Architecture
- Created reusable UI components: Button, Input, Label, Card
- Implemented authentication components: LoginForm, RegisterForm, AuthCard
- Used TypeScript with strict typing throughout
- Followed Next.js 15 App Router patterns with client components

## Next Steps

### Immediate (High Priority)
- [ ] Implement actual backend authentication service
- [ ] Create protected dashboard route for post-login redirect
- [ ] Add server-side form validation and security measures
- [ ] Implement session management and JWT tokens

### Short-term (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Add loading states and better UX during form submission
- [ ] Implement forgot password functionality
- [ ] Add email verification for registration
- [ ] Create user profile management

### Long-term (Lower Priority)
- [ ] Add advanced form validation patterns
- [ ] Implement role-based access control
- [ ] Add social authentication options
- [ ] Enhanced accessibility testing and improvements

## Active Decisions

### Authentication Strategy
- **Decision**: Start with client-side forms for rapid prototyping
- **Rationale**: Allows UI development while backend architecture is planned
- **Next**: Need to decide on authentication service (NextAuth.js, Supabase, custom)

### UI Component Strategy
- **Decision**: Custom components following shadcn/ui patterns
- **Rationale**: Provides flexibility and consistency without external dependencies
- **Next**: Consider adding shadcn/ui for more complex components as needed

### Form Validation Approach
- **Decision**: Client-side validation with TypeScript and custom hooks
- **Rationale**: Provides immediate user feedback and type safety
- **Next**: Add server-side validation for security when backend is implemented
