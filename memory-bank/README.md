# Memory Bank

This directory contains the core documentation files that preserve project context, requirements, and progress. These files are essential for maintaining continuity and understanding across all development sessions.

## Static Site Focus

This project is a static AI marketplace. There is no backend, server-side logic, database, or authentication. All features are implemented client-side or as static assets.

## Structure

- `projectbrief.md`: Core project requirements and goals
- `productContext.md`: Product context and user experience goals
- `activeContext.md`: Current work focus and recent changes
- `systemPatterns.md`: System architecture and design patterns
- `techContext.md`: Technologies, setup, and dependencies
- `progress.md`: Progress tracking and known issues

## Usage

Update these files as the project evolves to ensure all context and decisions are preserved for future work. All documentation should reflect the static-only nature of the project.
